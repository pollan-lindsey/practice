//make an array with four names
const nameArray = ["Becki", "Alex", "Scott", "Lindsey"];
//make the function with name nameFunction
function nameFunction(){
//set a variable for the popped array elements to go to
let fourNames = nameArray.pop();
//return the names in a way that doesn't make the button disappear
document.getElementById("buttonOne").innerHTML = fourNames;
}






// console.log(names);
// console.log(nameArray);
// //write the element on the page
// document.write(names);
//write the name as it pops
//what kind of loop do I use with this?
